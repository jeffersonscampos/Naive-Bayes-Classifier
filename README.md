# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

A simple implementation of Naive Bayes CLassifier model from the GaussianNB class. The sklearn.naive_bayes was imported to get access the GaussianNB class.

A confusion matrix was created to test the accuracy of the predicted values with the actual values of the dataset. A total of 10 incorrect prediction was made by the classifier model.
